Derived from the [Radix Colors](https://www.radix-ui.com/colors), Park UI's color palette maintains a balance between
accessibility and brand identity, with some tweaks to its naming scheme.

## Colors

Grays are integral for achieving visual balance. They provide contrast and direct the user's attention.

## Accent Colors

Accents define the primary tone of the UI and play a significant role in shaping brand recognition.
